<h2>Lentils and Rice</h2>
<p>Ingredients (serves 4)</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 medium cloves garlic, smashed and peeled</li>
	<li>2 bay leaves</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>1 ¾ teaspoons fine sea salt, divided</li>
	<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
	<li>5 cups water</li>
	<li>1 cup white basmati rice (regular, not quick-cooking), rinsed and drained</li>
	<li>1 cup regular brown or green lentils, picked over for debris, rinsed and drained</li>
	<li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>2 medium-to-large yellow onions, halved and thinly sliced</li>
	<li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions (from 1 bunch), divided</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Recipe</p>
<ol>
	<li>In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, combine the garlic, bay leaves, cumin, 1 ½ teaspoons of the salt and about 20 twists of freshly ground black pepper. Add the water and bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
	<li>Cook the lentils in the boiling water first for about 10 minutes (until somewhat softened on the outside/still firm in the middle), then add the rice and cook until both lentils and rice are tender, about 25 minutes.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, warm the olive oil in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat. When it’s warm enough that a slice of onion sizzles on contact, add the remaining onions. Stir to combine.</li>
	<li>Stir only every 3 minutes or so at first, then more often once the onions at the edges of the pan start browning. If the onions are browning before they have softened, dial down the heat to give them more time. Cook until the onions are deeply caramelized and starting to crisp at the edges, about 20 to 30 minutes. In the meantime, line a large plate or cutting board with a couple paper towels.</li>
	<li>Using a slotted spoon or fish spatula, transfer the onions to the lined plate and spread them evenly across. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ teaspoon salt over the onions. They’ll crisp up as they cool.</li>
	<li>When the lentils and rice are done cooking, drain off any excess water (if there is any) and return the mixture to the pot, off the heat. Lay a kitchen towel across the top of the pot to absorb steam, then cover the pot and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
	<li>Remove the lid, discard the bay leaves, and smash the garlic cloves against the side of the pan with a fork. Add about ¾ths of the green onions, reserving the rest for garnish. Gently stir and fluff the rice with a fork. Season to taste with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.</li>
	<li>Transfer the rice and lentil mixture to a large serving platter or bowl. Top with the caramelized onions and the remaining green onions. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature, with yogurt and spicy sauce (optional) on the side.</li>

## Shrimp and Chive Crystal Dumplings

https://mission-food.com/chinese-chive-dumplings/ but combined with Kenji's pork and shrimp dumpling recipe seasonings

Makes ~40 dumplings (2 servings)

Filling:
2 tsp soy sauce
2 tsp shaoxing wine
1 tsp cornstarch
2/3 lb fresh shrimp, shelled, deveined, and cut into 1/4" pieces
2 tsp sugar
1/4 tsp white pepper
2 tsp garlic, minced
2 tsp ginger, minced
1 tsp sesame oil
2 tbsp dried shrimp, finely chopped
16 or 12 oz Chinese chives, finely chopped

Dough:
9 oz wheat starch
4 1/2 oz tapioca starch
1/4 tsp salt
2 cups just-boiled water
8 tsp canola oil

Or use normal dumpling wrappers and skip all this nonsense. Arrange in single layer on a tray and freeze until solid. Then transfer to ziplock freezer bag.

Instructions for filling:
Combine filling ingredients and mix until slightly tacky.

Test filling by taking dime-sized bit and pan fry. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

Instructions for dough:
In a bowl combine wheat starch, tapioca starch, and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in about 14 tbsp of water (in between 3/4 cup and 1 cup in measuring cup). Use sturdy metal spoon to stir together. Will look translucent then mottled, whitish, and lumpy.

Once water has been roughly incorporated, add the 4 tsp oil. Stir with spoon, then later with hands to work oil in. If dough looks dry, add a little more water. Aim for medium firm texture. Add wheat starch by tbsp if dough too wet. Press ingredients into ball that feels a little bouncy.

Knead dough until snowy white and smooth, like Play-doh. Squeezing it should not result in cracks. If it cracks, lightly oil one hand and knead it into the dough.

Cut dough up into 3 equal pieces (use scale for accuracy), then place into ziplock bag to rest for 5 minutes. 

Instructions for assembly:
Cut open sides of ziplock bag so it's only got one connected edge (bottom). Smear a little oil inside the bag.

Take 1 of the dough pieces and roll into 6 inch log. Cut into 6 equal pieces. To prevent drying and sticking, dab finger in oil and rub on ends of dough pieces, pressing into 1/4 inch thick disk.

Place dough disk inside ziplock bag and press using bottom of skillet until 4 inches in diameter.

Hold disk in cupped hand. Place heaping teaspoon of filling into wrapper and flatten a bit. Fold, pleat, and press to enclose the filling. Try to make large pleats to dumpling isn't too thick. Pinch opening closed and twist off excess dough.

Place dumplings pleated side down on steamer. Steam for about 7 minutes or until they become puffy and are glossy and translucent. Arrange in single layer on a tray and freeze until solid. Then transfer to ziplock freezer bag.

## Walnut Shrimp

- 30 walnut halves 
- 3 to 4 cups canola oil (for frying, use the same oil for shrimp)
- 2 tablespoons water
- 2 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon salt

For the shrimp:

- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk
- ¼ teaspoon rice vinegar
- 2 teaspoons honey (optional)
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 pound shrimp (450g, 16/20 size shrimp peeled and deveined)
- 1/3 cup cornstarch

- Heat enough canola oil in a small pot, so that it’s deep enough to submerge a whole shrimp. This is why the recipe calls for a range of 3 to 4 cups. When the oil reaches 325 degrees F, fry the walnuts for about 4 minutes. They are ready when they start to turn a golden brown color. Some people like their walnuts more or less toasted, so you can experiment to your own taste. The difference is really in the last 30 to 60 seconds, so make that decision quickly!
- While the oil is heating, pour 2 tablespoons of water, granulated sugar and a pinch of salt into a small saucepan over low heat to make your simple syrup. Stir occasionally to reduce, 3 to 5 minutes. Once the walnuts are done, scoop them out quickly with a slotted spoon, draining as much oil off as possible. Transfer them to the saucepan with your simple syrup.
- Continue stirring the walnuts in the simple syrup over medium low heat until there is no remaining liquid in the saucepan, and the syrup is completely coating the walnuts without dripping off. This step is important, because you want a thin and hard candy coating on your walnuts. If you take them out too early, they will be chewy rather than crunchy. When they are ready, transfer them to a parchment lined sheet pan, spreading them out so they are not touching each other.
- Next, combine the mayonnaise, condensed milk, rice vinegar, and salt in a small bowl, and stir until smooth. Set aside. You want this sauce to be at room temperature.
- Prepare the cleaned shrimp by first making the cuts on the back of the shrimp deeper, so they get a nice coating and will open up into a nice shape when fried.
- Dredge the shrimp in cornstarch lightly and set aside. Keep the remaining cornstarch handy, because you will probably have to lightly dredge again just before frying.
- Bring a pot of water to a boil for your broccoli, and add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon oil to the pot. Blanch the broccoli florets for 30 seconds, and immediately scoop them out. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. After 10 to 15 seconds in the water, drain into a colander. The broccoli should still be very warm, but the shock of the cold water will keep them green. Next, arrange them around the perimeter of a serving plate. Cook the broccoli just before you fry the shrimp, as the broccoli should be warm when served.
- Next, bring your frying oil (the same oil you used for the walnuts) up to 350 degrees F and dredge the shrimp for a second time in the remaining cornstarch, since the shrimp may have absorbed some of the cornstarch from the first dredging. Drop the shrimp one at a time into the oil carefully, but quickly in succession. You will have to do this in several batches, depending on the size of your pot. Keep in mind, you don’t want the shrimp to stick together, and you want to move quickly to drop in each batch of shrimp at around the same time so that they cook evenly and are done at the same time.
- Fry the shrimp in batches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes. Gently roll them around in the oil so they fry evenly, but take care so none of the oil splashes out of the pot.
- Transfer the fried shrimp to a large stainless steel mixing bowl. When all the shrimp have been fried, pour the creamy sauce mixture on top of the shrimp, and gently toss the shrimp in the sauce until coated. This process should be quick!
- Pour the shrimp onto the plate lined with broccoli, and sprinkle with the candied walnuts.


## Crispy Semi-Smashed New Potatoes

Serves 4-6

1.5 lbs new potatoes, scrubbed
Salt
1/4 cup canola oil
2 tbps chopped fresh herbs (chives)
Black pepper

Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with cold water (1 inch above). Salt heavily. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool slightly.

Adjust oven rack to middle and preheat oven to 250 F. Place potato on cutting board and smash gently to 1/2 inch thickness. Use spatula to scrape potato off and onto large plate. Repeat.

Heat oil in nonstick skillet over medium until shimmering. Add half of the potatoes and cook until golden brown and crisp on the bottoms, about 8 minutes. Shake pan gently. Reduce heat if potatoes threaten to burn. Flip and brown second side, another 8 minutes. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven during cooking of remaining potatoes.

When all potatoes are cooked, transfer to bowl, add herbs and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper and serve.

## Ketchup Shrimp

Serves 4

- 12 ounces large, shell-on headless shrimp(340g, 15 to 20 size)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil (divided)
- 7 slices fresh ginger (cut ⅛-inch thick)
- 1 clove garlic (sliced)
- 2 scallions (cut at an angle into 2-inch pieces, with the white and green parts separated)
- ¼ cup ketchup
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (optional)
- ⅛ teaspoon white pepper
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine
- 1-2 tsp soy sauce

- Rinse your shrimp under running water, and thaw if frozen. Pat dry with a paper towel. If desired, you can peel the shells off for easy eating, but do leave the tails on, as they add extra flavor when seared in the wok. (Note: We cooked and photographed this ketchup shrimp with the shells on like my mom used to do, but I have to admit, this dish may be better if the shrimp are peeled with only the tails left on.)
- Heat 1 tablespoon of canola or vegetable oil in your wok until it just starts to smoke. Fry the shrimp on both sides for 20 seconds on each side (15 seconds if you peeled the shells off), and set aside. The shrimp should be 80% cooked.
- Turn the heat down to low, and add another tablespoon of oil to your wok. Add the 7 slices of ginger, and let it infuse the oil for 15 seconds. Add sliced garlic and the white parts of the scallions. Turn the heat up to medium high and stir-fry everything for 10 seconds.
- Add ¼ cup ketchup and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce if using. Stir into the oil and fry for 15 seconds. Next, stir in the shrimp and any juices on the plate, and add ⅛ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sugar, and 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine.
- Stir for 10 seconds, and add 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Continue to stir-fry until the sauce begins the reduce and coats the shrimp. Finally, add the rest of the scallions (the green parts).
- Stir for another 10 seconds and transfer to a dish. Serve this ketchup shrimp dish with white rice and a side of veggies.

## Shrimp with Black Bean Sauce

Serves 2


Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken stock (heated until hot)
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 teaspoon dark soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
- 1/4 teaspoon sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon white pepper
- 1 tablespoon black bean garlic sauce
- 4 ounces ground pork
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 1/4 teaspoon ginger (minced)
- 1/4 cup green bell pepper (finely diced)
- 12 ounces peeled, deveined shrimp (21/25 size)
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 2 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch (mixed into a slurry with 2 tablespoons water)
- 1 large egg (lightly beaten)
- 1 scallion (chopped)

- Bring 2 to 3 cups of water to a boil in your wok. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl or liquid measuring cup, combine the chicken stock, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and white pepper. Place the fermented black beans in a strainer, and give them a quick rinse under running water. Set the sauce and fermented beans aside.
- When your water has come to a boil, stir in the ground pork, breaking up any clumps and cook for about 1 minute, until the pork is no longer pink. Remove from the wok using a fine mesh strainer, and set aside. (You can also give it a quick rinse to get rid of any foam or particles that could result in a cloudy sauce.)
- Clean and dry your wok, and place it over medium high heat. Add the oil, garlic, ginger, bell pepper, fermented black beans, and ground pork. Stir-fry for 20 seconds. Then add the shrimp, and pour the Shaoxing wine around the hot sides of the wok. Stir-fry for another 20 seconds.
- Stir the sauce mixture to make sure everything is well-incorporated, and add it to the wok. Bring to a simmer, and then gradually stir in the cornstarch slurry until thickened to your liking (you don’t have to use it all). If it gets too thick, just add a little more chicken stock or water. If it’s still too thin, add more slurry.
- Pour the slightly beaten egg across the surface of the sauce. Simmer for 10 seconds to set the egg, and then use your spatula to fold the egg into the sauce with a few strokes. Fold in the chopped scallion, and serve immediately with steamed rice.

## Egg Tarts (Dan Ta)

Makes 16 tarts
1 hour, 15 minute prep time, 25 minute cook time
https://thewoksoflife.com/hong-kong-egg-tarts/#wprm-recipe-container-30777

2 cups all purpose flour, fluffed and spooned into measuring cup
1/8 tsp salt
12 tbsp unsalted butter, slightly softened
2 tbsp cold water
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup hot water
1/2 cup evaporated milk, room temperature
3 eggs, room temperature
1 tsp vanilla extract

In bowl, combine flour and salt. 

Cut butter into small cubes and add it to the flour and salt. Butter should be just soft enough that it gives when you press it, but not so soft it collapses. Working quickly, break it up with your fingers until it resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized chunks of butter still in the mixture.

Add 2 tbsp cold water and bring dough  together with your hands. Add more water if necessary (starting with 1/2 tsp) and no more than 2 tsp. Wrap the dough tightly and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 6x15 inch rectangle. Avoid overworking it.

Fold top third of dough down to the center, then bottom third up and over that (like folding a sheet of paper to fit into an envelope). Rotate the dough a quarter turn left or right and roll out again into 6x15 inch rectangle. Fold into thirds again, cover, and chill for 1 hour.

While dough is resting, make filling. Dissolve sugar into 1 cup of hot water and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature. Whisk evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla together, then whisk in sugar water. Strain through fine mesh strainer into a container with a pour spout. Should yield approx 2 1/2 cups of custard.

Preheat oven to 375 F and position rack in lower third.

Roll out dough to 0.2inch/5mm thick, cut into 4-inch circles to fit mini tart tins of shallow non-stick muffin pan, leaving lip going over the top of the cup (tart shells will shrink). Take excess dough, re-roll, and cut more circles until you've got approx 16 of them.

Fill each tart shell about 3/4 full. If dough has an ample lip, fill it until where dough curves outward.

Once filled, immediately transfer into oven. Reduce heat immediately to 350 F and bake for 26-29 minutes until filling is set (toothpick should stand up)

Cool for 10 minutes at least before enjoying.

## Szechuan Chili Oil

- 1½ cups oil (ideally a vegetable, peanut, or grapeseed oil...light olive oil is fine, but it has a tendency to set in the fridge)
- 5 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick (preferably cassia cinnamon)
- 2 bay leaves
- 3 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns
- ¾ cup crushed red pepper flakes (Sichuan chili flakes are the best)
- 1 - 1½ teaspoons salt (to taste)

Instructions

- Heat the oil, star anise, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and Sichuan peppercorns in a small saucepan over medium high heat. When the oil starts to bubble slightly, turn the heat down to medium or low heat. The ideal heat should be about 225 to 250 degrees F so as not to burn the oil and spices. Caution that the oil and spices can burn really easily, so it's best to get a candy thermometer to monitor the oil temperature.
- Let the oil cook for 30 minutes like this. If you start to see that slight bubbling die down, periodically turn the heat back up to medium-high, then back down to low if it gets too hot.
- When the oil is done cooking, the seeds and pods should be darker in color, but not blackened (that means they burned, which results in subpar chili oil). Let the oil cool for 5 minutes if it is too hot - the temperature should still be 225 to 250 degrees F. In a separate heat-proof bowl, measure out the crushed red pepper flakes and salt.
- Remove the aromatics from the oil using a slotted spoon or fine mesh strainer. Slowly pour the oil over the chili flakes, and stir well. When completely cooled, transfer to a jar, and store in the refrigerator. The oil will keep for up to 6 months when stored this way (always remember to use a clean spoon to dip into the jar!)
